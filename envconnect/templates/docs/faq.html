                    TSP has three main objectives:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Learning:</strong> To make identifying and prioritizing environmental best practices easier and industry specific.</li>
                        <li><strong>Measuring:</strong> To provide benchmarking and meaningful measurement of an organization’s environmental performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improving:</strong> To enable improvement planning based on environmental and business value.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The purpose of TSP is to help accelerate the adoption of sustainability best practices by two user groups: 
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Any organization.</strong> For organizations beginning the process of implementing environmental sustainability measures, the process of identifying and prioritizing environmental issues can be complex, expensive and time consuming. TSP aims to make that process easier by providing industry segment-specific best practices that are prioritized by environmental and business value. It also provides tools for self-assessment and benchmarking, and planning tools to help identify improvement opportunities based on environmental and business value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Managers of multiple reporting entities</strong> (e.g. suppliers, owned facilities). The TSP capabilities described above can be used to accelerate the adoption of sustainability best practices by a target group. TSP also provides meaningful measures of quality and maturity of sustainability management for evaluation and reporting purposes (e.g. RFP, surveys, scorecards).</li>

                <dd>A <a href="{{'/docs/legend/'|site_prefixed}}">value ranking system</a> is used to assign environmental and business values to a best practice. Values are based on order-of-magnitude-level estimates of the potential value of implementing a best practice to its full extent and applicable scope. They are intended to provide high level ranking of best practices, rather than precise estimates. The actual value realized by an organization from implementing a best practice will vary widely due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, size of the organization, number and scale of projects, nature of activities or operations, geographic region, and best practice implementation extent and scope. If you have experience that indicates any of the assigned values would benefit from recalibration, please <a href="{{'contact/'|site_prefixed}}">contact us</a> so that we may refine the value(s) in question.</dd>

                <dd>No. There will no change your baseline score, or any subsequent improved scores. New best practices and your score against same will only be factored in to the next Assessment update you choose to record in the system.</dd>

                <dd>
Opportunity scores for a best practice represent the number of points by which you could increase your total points by implementing the practice. The total score (presented in the Scorecard) is your total points divided by the total number of points available for capture. Calculation used to derive opportunity score:  Opportunity score = (value assigned to a best practice) x ( 1 + implementation rate ) x (3 – value assigned to your response to the question "Is this practice implemented?")
                </dd>
                <dd><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span>: Using this methodology means that the opportunity score for any best practice will increase as the implementation rate for a practice increases (as new users complete the assessment and report implementing the practice). This results in a minor bias against early adoption of a practice; however, testing showed the bias to be negligible.</dd>

                <dd>Scores are assigned on the following basis:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Score for a single best practice:</strong> Your score for a best practice is calculated by multiplying the value assigned to the practice by the value assigned to your response to the question “Is this implemented as standard practice?” (See table below for values).</li>
                        <li><strong>Score for a section of best practices:</strong> Best practices are grouped into sections (e.g. Electricity/gas, Fuel, Waste/pollution). The scores for each best practice are used to calculate your percentage score for that section. Each section is also assigned a weight to indicate its relative significance against other sections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Total score:</strong> Sum of the totals for each section multiplied by their weight.</li>
                        <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note</span>: Your scores will change slightly as more respondents complete the Assessment for an industry segment.</li>

                <dd>Your relative position against peers in your industry segment is shown in the “Benchmark graph” section of your Scorecard.
